There is a start screen that summarizes how to play the game visually. How much damage you take from an obstacle will depend on which pokemon you
use to run through it. Also health can only be picked up by the pokemon of the same type.


<a name="br2"></a>**To play the game:**

\- git clone [https://github.com/trp02/pokeRun.git
](https://github.com/trp02/pokeRun.git)- have pygame installed

\- run **main.py**

\- versions used: **python 3.9.13**, **pygame 2.1.3**, should work on Windows and MacOS. Didn’t
work on clemson SoC virtual desktop due to “no audio device” error. Primary way I ran it was on
VSCode with pygame installed.

\- **Controls** : Left click to cycle character and space to jump
